Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

I want to change the world. Or at least impact it in a positive way. (I think everyone does to be honest, on some level.)

In retrospect, it all started when I was14 and I stumbled across watching documentaries such as: How the Universe works, How it's Made, The Future in 2050, etc. It made feel excited. I was a going to grow up and witness revolutions like flying cars, A.I, Robot helpers and even flying to mars! However, just watching the world change wasn't enough for me. I wanted to be a part of it. 


Thinking back the first time I even saw coding was in college. I overlooked my classmates screen and saw her typing in weird keywords and coloured lines. I asked her what she was doing and she told me about codecademy[https://www.codecademy.com/learn] and I decided to check it out. I checked it out and I was amazed. I started getting that fuzzy feeling again. It was like learning magic. I thought to myself that if I could master "The art of coding" that I would be able to change the world and create something fantastic for all the world to see.



About 4 weeks into it, I was immersed until it started getting hard. Then I took a break and that break turned into weeks and before I knew it I had forgotten about it for a while. I carried on with my education. When I was in lectures I started to forget why I was even there. From lecture to lecture, coursework to deadlines; my dreams were fading into the background. Near the end of 2019, I saw an ad for Flatiron School. The poster caught my eye. "Change the world with code." (Or somehing like that). I immediately looked it up when I got home. I couldn't believe it. 

They would teach us *actual* coding and programming in a class of like-minded and driven students, their campuses were amazing and their career services helping you land a job within 6 months? WHERE WAS THIS ALL MY LIFE? I knew this was what I missing in my life to help me achieve my dreams of becoming a software engineer. 

This was one opportunity I wasn't going to miss.

Look out for me in the next year.
